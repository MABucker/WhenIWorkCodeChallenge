### How to Run the Program
 - Run `php main.php`

### Implementation Logic 

- Created a generic classes as `Shift.php` which does the following main functions:
         
    - Calculates number of hours spent in a Shift.

    - Calculates the number of hours split across the weeks.

- Created a generic class as `WeeklyReport.php`, it performs      following functions: 


    - Loops over the shifts data provided in the `data.json` 

    -   Generates the report of the weekly regular hours, overtime hours and invalid shifts of the employees.


### Spend More Time

- If I had to spend more time on this problem, I would have tried multiple datasets to test my solution. 

- I would have designed a beautiful web interface where users could upload dataset file and the result could have been displayed to them.

- I would have generalized my code in such a way that even If we had to calculate number of hours for each employee for every week in the entire year, I would have shown that.

- Could have attached database to store the data in the most optimized way for analysis and future use.


### Technology 
 - Core PHP
